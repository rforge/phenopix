\arguments{

  \item{x}{seasonal cycle of one year}

  \item{approach}{approach to be used to calculate phenology metrics. 'White' (White et al. 1997) or 'Trs' for simple threshold.}

  \item{trs}{threshold to be used for approach "Trs"}

  \item{min.mean}{minimum mean annual value in order to calculate phenology metrics. Use this threshold to suppress the calculation of metrics in grid cells with low average values	}

  \item{formula}{Returned from previous steps of the process}

  \item{uncert}{should uncertainty be estimated?}

  \item{params}{Returned from previous steps of the process}

	\item{breaks}{Currently unused}
  
  \item{\dots}{further arguments (currently not used)}
